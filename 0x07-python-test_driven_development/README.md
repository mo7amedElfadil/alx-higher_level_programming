## Learning Python Test Drive Development
Welcome to the ALX "0x07-python-test_driven_development" repository! This repository is designed to provide a beginner-friendly approach to understanding Test Driven Development in Python. Whether you're new to programming or looking to enhance your Python skills, this resource aims to guide you through the fundamentals of TDD in a clear and accessible way.

## Introduction

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements. This project directory will give you a basic understanding of software testing, its types, methods, levels, and other related terminologies.

### The Python Test Cases and Unittests
There are 2 main ways we explore testing in this project:
- docttests
	- module and function documentation
	- test tiles
- unittest

**The Rules are:**

- All test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__`)'

## Getting Started

To get started with this learning resource, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mo7amedElfadil/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```
Explore the Content:
Navigate through the provided examples and exercises in the repository.

Run the Code:
Execute the Python scripts in your preferred development environment to see the modules in action.

Learn by Doing:
Modify the code, experiment with different scenarios and tests.

## Usage

Each Python script in this repository contains one or more classes, allowing you to focus on specific concepts. Create a main file and import the desired file as a module:
```python
add_integer = __import__('0-add_integer')
```
or the function itself
```python
add_integer = __import__('0-add_integer').add_integer
```
And then test them out. Feel free to modify them to deepen your understanding, experiment, break things, and learn from the experience!

You can then run the scripe
```bash
python3 your_script_name.py
```
