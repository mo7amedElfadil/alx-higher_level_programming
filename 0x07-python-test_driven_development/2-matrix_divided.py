This is the matrix_divided module.

The module supplies one function, matrix_divided().  For example,
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div)

Rules:
    matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise:
        raise a TypeError exception with the message:
            "matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats"
    Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise:
        raise a TypeError exception with the message:
            "Each row of the matrix must have the same size"
    div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise:
        raise a TypeError exception with the message:
            "div must be a number"
    div canâ€™t be equal to 0, otherwise:
        raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message:
            "division by zero"
    All elements of the matrix should be divided by div,
        rounded to 2 decimal places
    Returns a new matrix
"""


def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
    """
    Return the a new matrix made up of the quotients of the matrix
    divided by a number (int / float).


    Parameters:
    - matrix (list): 2D list (n * m) of ints/floats.
    - div (int/float, Optional): number to divide matrix by.

    Returns:
    list:  2D list (n * m) of result of division as floats.

    Example:

    #testing printing return value of matrix_divided when matrix isn't defined
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))

    #testing when div is a char
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, '3'))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
