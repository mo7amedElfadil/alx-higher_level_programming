## Introduction

Understanding classes is a crucial step in mastering Python and object-oriented programming (OOP). Classes allow you to structure your code in a modular and organized manner, promoting reusability and maintainability. This repository is tailored for learners who want to grasp the basics of classes and gain hands-on experience through practical examples.

### The four major principles of object-orientation

- Encapsulation
- Data Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. 
> Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line, a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product.
> An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on an assembly line. In addition, the object contains behavior, like the action that each assembly line component performs.

### Classes vs Instances
Classes allow you to create user-defined data structures.  Classes define functions called #methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
We'll use a Dog class that stores some information about the characteristics and behaviors that an individual dog can have.
A class is a blueprint for how to define something. It doesn’t actually contain any data. The Dog class specifies that a name and an age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn’t contain the name or age of any specific dog.
While the class is the blueprint, an #instance is an object that’s built from a class and contains real data. An instance of the Dog class is not a blueprint anymore. It’s an actual dog with a name, like Miles, who’s four years old.
Put another way, a class is like a form or questionnaire. An instance is like a form that you’ve filled out with information. Just like many people can fill out the same form with their own unique information, you can create many instances from a single class.

## Getting Started

To get started with this learning resource, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mo7amedElfadil/alx-higher_level_programming.git
```
Explore the Content:
Navigate through the provided examples and exercises in the repository.

Run the Code:
Execute the Python scripts in your preferred development environment to see the classes in action.

Learn by Doing:
Modify the code, experiment with different scenarios, and observe how classes behave.

## Contents

1. Square Class
Explore the fundamentals of creating a basic class to represent a square. Understand how to initialize instances, use properties, and implement methods.

2. Square Class with Position
Build on your knowledge by adding more features to the square class, such as a position attribute. Learn how to enhance classes with additional properties and methods.

3. Singly linked List

## Usage

Each Python script in this repository contains one or more classes, allowing you to focus on specific concepts. Create a main file and import the desired file as a module:
```python
import 0-square
```
or the class itself
```python
from 6-square import Square
```
And then create an instance for the class and test it out. Feel free to modify them to deepen your understanding, experiment, break things, and learn from the experience!

You can then run the scripe
```bash
python3 your_script_name.py
```
